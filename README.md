# MiniOps.jl

A lightweight, matrix-free linear operator framework for inverse problems, signal processing, seismic imaging, and PDE/FWI kernels.

`MiniOps` allows you to write expressions such as:

```julia
y  = A * x
x̂  = A' * y
L  = R * F * A
z  = L * x
```

where `A`, `F`, `R`, … are linear **operators**, not matrices. 

The goals:

- Minimal but powerful abstraction  
- Matrix-free forward/adjoint operators 
- Shape-agnostic (1D, 2D, ND arrays)  
- Real/complex type-agnostic  
- Clean algebra: composition, adjoint, scalar multiplication  
- Essential operators:
  - 1D convolution
  - columnwise convolution
  - sampling
  - scaling & diagonal ops
  - FFT / inverse FFT
- Diagnostics: adjoint test, linearity test, norm estimate (max  eigenvalue of A'A)

MiniOps supports two design families of linear operators:

 - Size-agnostic operators (generic, work on any array)
 - Size-fixed operators (optimized, assume a known grid)

Both approaches have advantages and trade-offs. 

Size-Agnostic Operators: A size-agnostic operator does not know the shape of the input a priori.
It simply takes whatever array you give it and applies the transform.
Example: unitary FFT defined as closures:

```julia
F = fft_op()          # works for any shape
y = F * x
x2 = F' * y
```

Size-Fixed (Planned) Operators: A size-fixed operator stores shape information at construction time.
This enables precomputation and better performance.

```julia
F = fft_op(x0)        # remembers size(x0)
y = F * x
```
When to Use Which Approach

Use size-agnostic operators for:

- Classroom demonstrations.
- Quick experiments.
- Code that must accept arbitrary input.

Use size-fixed operators for:

- Production solvers.
- Iterative schemes (ISTA, FISTA, CG, LSQR).
- Full waveform inversion, RTM, Radon transforms and any operator used inside a loop called many times




# 1. Installation & Usage

# 2. Core Concept: `Op`

An `Op` represents a matrix-free linear operator:

```julia
struct Op{F,FT}
    f::F      # forward  x -> A*x
    ft::FT    # adjoint  y -> A'*y
    m::Int    # number of elements in codomain (optional)
    n::Int    # number of elements in domain   (optional)
    name::Symbol
end
```

### Key ideas:

- `f`/`ft` are closures (forward/adjoint).
- `m` and `n` default to `-1` (shape unknown).
- Operators compose:

```julia
L = R * F * A
```

- Adjoint works automatically:

```julia
At = A'
```

- Operators work on arrays of **any shape**.

### Primary overloads:

| Expression           | Meaning                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| `A * x`              | forward                         |
| `A(x)`               | same as above                   |
| `A' * y`             | adjoint                         |
| `C = A * B`          | composition                     |
| `size(A)`            | returns `(m,n)`                 |
| `α * A`              | scalar multiplication           |

# 3. Helper: `with_shape`

Assign meaningful `(m,n)` based on a sample input:

```julia
A_shaped = with_shape(A, x0)
```

Sets:

- `n = length(vec(x0))`
- `m = length(vec(A*x0))`

Example:

```julia
F = fft_op()
X0 = randn(ComplexF64,128,128)
F = with_shape(F, X0)
@show size(F)
```
